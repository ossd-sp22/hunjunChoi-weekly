<h2 id="part-1">Part 1</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Diverse opinions and voices from different people are essential in developing an open source project. Through various ideas of involved contributors regardless of their characteristics generate undreamed features, promote extraordinay inspiration, and advance the projectsâ€™ capability. Nevertheless, contributors are mortals who commonly find themselves in a dispute. The code of conduct document for a project lists out the responsibility and duty that members of a project must adhere to maintain a professional and hospitable community where every developer can engage and focus on the growth of a project. The document attests to the logistical virtues and accountabilities for the members of a community to facilitate healthier communication along with the penalties that one will be punished in the case of decrying othersâ€™ efforts or breaching the essence listed under. Furthermore, the document realizes the place to contact for anyone who receives and views unnecessary harassment from other members of the group that setback a person from attempting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any project that opens its door to anyone interested in advancing the projectâ€™s value will benefit from outlining the code of conduct document. Most of the contributors of a project are unidentified and unknown to other contributors working on the same project. The mode of communication is online where people are susceptible to be unusually aggressive toward one another with the power of anonymity. The document guidelines the members to accept constructive criticisms and opposing viewpoints to prevent the project from becoming monotonous.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compared to the contributor covenant code of conduct, the GO project has made a few additions to its document. First, the GO project broadens the scope of their code of conductâ€™s application with the authority of the project maintainer. The project clarifies the situation decided by the Project Stewards to maintain the elegancy of the project and the community behind it. Second, the GO project edited the Enforcement section of the Contributor Covenant to suit their appetite. The project explains detailed procedure and resolution that the leadership team will do to alert a member in need of help about the representing office and team in assisting with the matter.</p>

  <li>Apart from the GO projectâ€™s proprietary community values so-called Gopher values, there is a minor difference in Eclipseâ€™s code of conduct and that of Goâ€™s. Noticeably, Eclipse foundation uses its terminology in describing the participants and the organizers of the project. The reason for the different naming schemes is, presumably, due to the difference in the size of the two projects. If the volume of contributors for Eclipse is larger than that of GO, Eclipse might have decided to sub-divide the developers involved to strongly distinguish the people as Community Members, Contributors, Committers, Project Leaders, and Eclipse Foundation Staff each assigned with specific roles in the project.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="part-2">Part 2</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Sugar Labsâ€™ code of conduct is based on the Ubuntu Code of Conduct. Similar to that of the GO project, Sugar Labsâ€™ code of conduct listed out the etiquettes that the community must abide by for cooperative efforts. On the other hand, there isnâ€™t a direct communication channel to the maintainers mentioned in the Sugar Labsâ€™ code of conduct. The project has not clearly defined the enforcement that the leadership will carry out for inappropriate incidents reported and the absence of authority and responsibility that project maintainers could execute to nix out the misbehaviors of the community members.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="part-3">Part 3</h2>

<ul>
  <li>https://developer.squareup.com/blog/open-source-code-of-conduct/</li>
  <li>The code of conduct for Square open source, which is based on the work of four different communities, is a mixture of that of the GO project and that of Sugar Labs. Square pointed out the community characteristics to ensure a diverse and edifying environment for all distinct contributors involved as there are in GOâ€™s. Square also discussed the medium, method, and consequences of reporting misconduct, which was not explicitly referenced in Sugar Labsâ€™.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="add-on-activity">Add-on Activity</h1>

<ul>
  <li>As the name of the first add-on activity suggests, the mock add-on that worked during class was my first add-on for a browser. The activity was extremely useful and valuable to grasp the fundamentals in creating an add-on. Performing the activity was very interesting and surfaced the curiosity in scrutinizing the skeleton codes to fully understand the concept. However, it left a bit of intimidation for when we create our own add-on. My goal is to not be a burden to my team.</li>
