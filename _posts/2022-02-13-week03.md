### Jim Hall's visit

-   This week, we had an honor to invite Jim Hall, the founder as well as project manager of FreeDOS open source software, to our class where he carried out remarkable speech about the essence of Open Source Software and instructive answers during Q&A with the students. Jim started his lecture with the timeline of software, of which majority of students are insensible about because the topic isn't commonly taught in college courses. Once Jim brought about open source software, he reminded all of us
    in the class of the importance of licence. Jim remarked about the ubiquitousness of early softwares being proprietary denying the access to thier source code and the comparison of OpenDOS and FreeDOS, which weren't considered open in his opinion due to instability of licenses that were used in early days.

-   Jim is a string advocate of Open source softwares, in which 27 years of his career is spent. Jim pointed out that Open source accelrates innovation when talking about the transition of software from closed to open loomed in early 2000's. I value his thought because in fast-chaning world innovations are necessary to stay ahead of the compeititors and prevent products from goining obsolete. Another core characteristic of Open source that he mentioned was diversity of contributors. Inclusiveness of Open source softwares so that anyone with interest can contribute to projects is the key of publishing open source. Intriguingly, to maximize participation in FreeDOS, which Jim is actively coordinating, he created a multi-lingual library such that developers around the globe are able to contirbute to the project using their native language. The library idea he performed to globalize not only his work but also all the other Open source softwares was extremely fascinating.

-   Jim reinformed the significancy of hospitable community around Open source softwares; hence the need of a code of conduct for every open projects. Although open source have maintainers who accomodate the project's general direction and implementation, open source softwares are facilitates by the community with various personalities behind them. When a community of a project ward off newcomers from entering or manifests snub to other's contribution, the pool of diversity will shrink and individual contributors begin to work independently where exchange of sparking notions is stopped, such that the project is ill-fated from its growth.
